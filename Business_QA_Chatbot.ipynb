This series is geared toward the budding entrepreneur that is either an artist, writer, scientists or engineer who struggle everyday to grasp the basics of business and sell what they create. One thing to remember is that business is not that hard – it’s just a diﬀerent way of thinking. You don’t have to sell out or compromise to be successful. The trick is to understand what you want out of a venture and move towards those goals. The best way to do that is to get the basics down before you jump in.\n",

The term business has many deﬁnitions from the practice of to the type an entity is engaged in. A business can be as small as a single person or as large as a multinational conglomerate. They are as diverse as the people who run them. At the core of a business is some goods or services that is oﬀered to customers. All businesses provide some form of product or service to someone.

Some business do generate proﬁt but there are several others (government, education and non-proﬁts) that provide valuable goods and services for no proﬁt. Without these organizations, society would not function. The principles in this series will apply to all businesses since, fundamentally, they all serve a customer. Another aspect of the deﬁnition is the inclusion of community. All businesses impacts the community. Businesses create jobs, provide essential services and pay taxes. Without a thriving business base, there is no community. That’s why a business also needs to understand its impact on the community. Now that we have deﬁned what a business is, we can now ﬁgure out how to manage them. The ﬁrst step is to clearly deﬁne what the objectives are.

The best example is global climate change and how the selling of fossil fuels aﬀects the worlds climate. The impact of maximizing oil company proﬁts has lead to global climate change that injuries society in irreversible ways. Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) has increasing appeal to shareholders because of the social shift to being more sustainable. Some european countries (like Denmark) have a CSR law that requires companies to either state their CSR policy or list that they don’t have one. CSR has its critics.

            "To start, we will focus on microeconomics and the main theory behind it – supply and demand. Supply is the amount of goods for sale while demand is the requested amount of such goods. Both values form curves with quantity on the X-axis and price on the Y-axis. They are typically drawn together to form a supply and demand curve (see this article for an example curve). These two curves describe the quantity and price dynamics that supply and demand have on the product or service. When they are in equilibrium (i.e. the supply and demand stay constant over a period of time) then the resulting price obtained is the market clearing price. Now, it might seem like an impossible feat but this condition happens all the time. That is how transactions get done and the premise behind eﬃcient markets (since the market knows what price will create equilibrium and wants to achieve it).\n",

            "Lots of things but mostly, the wants and needs of consumers and businesses. These needs drive more (or less) production which eﬀects prices. These eﬀects are captured, per market, in elasticities of supply and demand. Elasticity of demand is the decrease in quantity desired given a small percentage increase in price. Elasticity of supply is similar. It’s the measure of the change in supplied goods given a small increase in price. What happens is these two elasticities push and pull against each other, ﬁghting for equilibrium. When that happens, everyone is happy and transactions occur. That’s why it’s important to understand these elasticity numbers for your particular market since that will drive how much you supply. Lets look at some market examples of supply and demand in action.\n",

We all deal with money and understand what we pay taxes, that we have stuﬀ (assets) and our checking account is mostly balanced (wait, I should double check that). If you invest, then you have surely looked at a ﬁnancial statement or two and probably wondered, what does it all mean? Well, it means a lot. In fact, accounting is the only consistent language that all businesses understand. You can go anywhere in the world and they will all have ﬁnancial statements.

They have really complicated rules and procedures but it all boils down to show me where the money came from and what we spent it on. Simple. Well, maybe. You see, most companies kind of, sort of, well, make their own accounting rules that they refer to as pro forma. Pro forma accounting reports can be misleading since it’s really up to the company to deﬁne it (well, within reason). That’s why it’s critical to understand what a pro forma ﬁnancial statement is really saying. Typically, pro forma earns are greater than GAAP, which makes some critics charge that you really can’t compare diﬀerent companies based on pro forma earnings. For our discussions, we will deal with GAAP deﬁnitions since that is consistent across companies.\n",

Achieving balance requires that a change in one account must be matched with a change in another account. This is heart of the double entry method. Any deviation from balance, means that an accounting error has occurred. The theory behind the equation is that someone must provide assets or resources so that the company can operate. If that holds true, then the Assets of the company have to equal the equity provided. Liabilities comes in when non-company owners (say a vendor), supplies credit to the company.

The most important consideration when modeling your sales is to select clearly deﬁned and measurable metrics other than sales numbers.

Some common pre-sales metrics include: Customer visits, formal quotes, purchase orders or contract renewal.

This is precisely the wrong thing to do. A downturn is the perfect time to invest in innovative since once the downturn is over, you will be ready.

Another burden is that the invention has to original, which means that there is no other prior art that explains what you want to patent. There is also a burden of obviousness as well as breaking the known laws of physics. In the US, you have to be the ﬁrst to invent something not the ﬁrst to ﬁle, which means if there is a dispute about an invention date, then you need documentation that proves when you invented something.

Part of the product lifecycle is knowing when your product oﬀerings are maturing and you need to develop new and better products. Most companies deﬁne their product lifecycle around some industry metrics or trade shows. For example, the semiconductor industry uses Moore’s Law to drive the development and launch of new technologies, toy companies focus on the christmas sales season, while consumer electronics are pretty much deﬁned at the Consumers Electronics Show (CES).

It’s scary when someone wants to sue your company but the legal system, for all it faults and issues, does provide a reasonable framework for resolving business disputes.

In general, your biggest compliance headache will be in trying to ﬁgure out what taxes you owe, employee rules and safety laws. In most cases, compliance is left to the business owner and as long as the taxes are paid on time and no one registers a complaint, most government departments will not be knocking at your door. Compliance becomes challenging when the law changes or you assumed you did not have to performa a certain task. In these cases, ignorance of the law is no excuse. So, to cover yourself and your business, ensure that you get “no need to comply” decisions in writing. That way, at least you will have a something in writing as to why you did not comply.\n",

A proper ﬁnancial model also forces you to ask the tough questions about where each and every dollar is going. Your potential investors need to understand that the money you are asking for has some basis in reality. Having a ﬁnancial model sets that reality. It also is a tool for you to reﬁne your ventures operations and run scenarios. In some cases, you may not get all the money you want. With a solid ﬁnancial model, you can adjust accordingly.\n",

The only problem with that approach is the learning curve, cost and inﬂexible input. You really can’t enter in equations nor can you format the output like you want it. There are many schools of thought on granularity or details for a model. The level of detail will depend on your business and how much money you need. If the business is a coﬀee shop, single person consulting ﬁrm, dog walking business or restaurant, then the simple one month is a good start. For a more complicated business (like one that needs a signiﬁcant amount of investment), a detailed monthly cash budget makes more sense. The simplest ﬁnancial model is a basic cash (Income/Expense) budget. In a startup, cash is king. So, understanding every single expense is critical.
